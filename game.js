/* 
    Requirements for this game:
        * The game is played between an user and computer
        * Computer needs to generate random hand (rock, paper, scissors)
            - generate a random integer number between 1-3.
            - Link these numbers to a hand and return:
                - 1 = rock
                - 2 = paper
                - 3 = scissors
        * User needs to type it's choice
        * compute the results
            - rock wins against scissors but losses against paper
            - paper wins against rock but losses against scissors
            - Scissors wins against paper but losses against rock
        * return who the winner is
    
    - things to consider -
        * users input should be accepted even if it's lowercase or upptercase
        * Each hand, should be linked to a number due to the random number generation
